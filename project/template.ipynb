    "# Week 2 Project: Refining the Art of Sentiment Analysis at ModaMetric\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to Week 2! The ModaMetric team is still buzzing from the achievements of last week. You've shown them the power of Metaflow and the potential of machine learning. However, there's more to explore, more to refine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once again, weâ€™ll delve into the [Women's Ecommerce Clothing Reviews Dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nicapotato/womens-ecommerce-clothing-reviews), the dataset that helped us unlock valuable insights for ModaMetric. Your mission is to further refine the sentiment analysis process, enabling ModaMetric to better understand the sentiments embedded in the customer reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task 1: Orchestrating the Dance of Sentiment Analysis Models with Metaflow\n",
    "\n",
    "In this task, you'll utilize Metaflow to train two sentiment analysis models: the baseline \"majority class\" classifier and your own custom model. The models will be trained simultaneously, flexing the power of Metaflow. Your task also involves tweaking the models' hyperparameters for optimal performance. Finally, you'll analyze the performance of these models using Metaflow's Client API. Here's how you'll proceed:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Constructing the Sentiment Analysis Workflows\n",
    "Your first task is to construct the Metaflow workflows. Begin with the baseline \"majority class\" classifier and then move on to your custom model. Make sure your custom model includes steps for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. Feel free to use techniques from Week 1 and any other [resources](https://outerbounds.com/docs/nlp-tutorial-L2/) you find useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Parallel Training of Models\n",
    "Having built the models, you'll use Metaflow to train them simultaneously. The race is on - can the custom model outshine the baseline? If you find yourself in a bind, you might find the [FlowSpec branching documentation](https://docs.metaflow.org/metaflow/basics#branch) useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: The Hyperparameters Experiment\n",
    "Once you've trained the models, it's time for some fine-tuning. Experiment with different hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs. Record the performance of each model under different hyperparameter combinations as Data Artifacts in Metaflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Results Analysis\n",
    "With the experiments complete, it's time to analyze the results. Use Metaflow's Client API to fetch the data and create visualizations to compare the models' performances. The goal is to identify the best hyperparameters for each model.\n",
    "\n",
    "By completing this task, you're not only refining the sentiment analysis process at ModaMetric but also honing your own skills in orchestrating complex machine learning workflows using Metaflow.\n"

    "## Task 2: Mastering the Art of Anticipation: Failures and Remedies in ModaMetric's Machine Learning Journey\n",
    "\n",
    "In this task, your challenge is to step into the role of a foresightful data scientist at ModaMetric, where you'll be anticipating potential pitfalls in the sentiment analysis classifier project. Not just that, but you'll also be charting out strategies to steer clear of these hitches. Here's how you'll navigate through:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Forecasting Potential Failure Modes\n",
    "\n",
    "The key to overcoming challenges is to anticipate them. Start by picturing possible failure scenarios from an engineering perspective. For instance, you might think about problems like overfitting to the training data or biases in the data. Remember, the first step to finding a solution is acknowledging the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "________________________________________\n",
    "Data Drift: There is a high chance that incoming data may not be representative of the population or the data on which the model was trained. Consequently, inferences generated from the model can be misleading. \n",
    " \n",
    "Model Drift: Additionally, as the model is periodically retrained, there is a high likelihood that retraining on new data (which may differ from the original data or population) can lead to a drift in model predictions. This, in turn, may result in unreliable inferences.\n",
    "________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Strategizing to Mitigate Failure Modes\n",
    "\n",
    "Having identified the potential obstacles, your next task is to devise counter-strategies. Consider what steps you'd take to address the problem if it arises. For instance, to counter overfitting, you could employ regularization techniques such as L1 or L2 regularization. Think of this step as drawing up a contingency plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "________________________________________\n",
    "Data Drift: To address Data Drift, it's important to determine whether the newly observed data behavior is evolving in nature or merely noise. Depending on this assessment, you can take one of two approaches. If the data is evolving, retraining the model on a new dataset can capture the changing data dynamics. On the other hand, if it's noise, data can be filtered to better represent the original population and subsequently used for training or inference.\n",
    " \n",
    "Model Drift: Continuous monitoring of metrics such as Precision, Relevance, and AUC-ROC is crucial for detecting any shifts in the model's predictions. To mitigate Model Drift, it's advisable to treat predictions with high uncertainty separately and give them special consideration.\n",
    "________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Planning Ahead to Dodge Failure Modes\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond reactive strategies, you also need a proactive plan. What could you have done at the outset to avoid these potential pitfalls? Could you have collected a more diverse dataset to reduce bias? Or experimented with different model architectures? The goal is to minimize reactive measures and maximize foresight.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "________________________________________\n",
    "Model Versioning: Keep track of different versions of your models. This allows you to revert to a previous version if you detect significant model drift in the latest version.\n",
    " \n",
    "Ensemble Models: As with data drift, ensemble models can help mitigate model drift by combining predictions from multiple models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Uncertainty Estimation: Implement techniques to estimate and quantify uncertainty in model predictions. Predictions with high uncertainty can be treated differently or subjected to further scrutiny.\n",
    "________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "This task emphasizes the importance of anticipation in machine learning projects. By identifying possible failure modes and crafting mitigation strategies, you'll be preparing yourself for a smooth-sailing machine learning journey at ModaMetric.\n"

    "## Task 3: Bringing ML Results to Life: ModaMetric's Visualization Adventure with MF Cards\n",
    "\n",
    "It's time for you to go beyond the code and transform data into a visual narrative. As a member of ModaMetric's data science team, your next mission is to enhance the existing flow in your `baseline_challenge.py` file. Add a new layer that gathers the results from all the hyperparameter tuning jobs. But that's not all - you're also going to breathe life into this aggregated data by creating a data visualization using Metaflow cards. Here's what you need to do:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Extend Your Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "Your first challenge is to add another level to your existing `baseline_challenge.py` file. This new addition should be able to collate all the outcomes from your various hyperparameter tuning jobs. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Log Results and Create Data Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've collected the outcomes, it's time to log the results in a structured way. Then, you're going to take this information and create a compelling data visualization using Metaflow cards. Remember, a picture is worth a thousand numbers. With these visual insights, you'll be enabling ModaMetric to understand the performance of your machine learning model in a glance.\n",
    "\n",
    "This task is your opportunity to blend your technical skills with creative thinking. By visualizing your ML results, you're not only making the data more digestible but also contributing to ModaMetric's data-driven decision-making process."

    "As ModaMetric continues to thrive and grow, it's clear that basic visualizations won't be enough to understand the intricate dynamics of our e-commerce customer sentiment. We want to take our data storytelling to the next level. And you, as a valued member of our data science team, are the perfect person to lead this initiative.\n",
    "\n",
    "This optional task is an open invitation for you to really explore how you can leverage Metaflow's features to deliver a compelling, multidimensional story.\n",

    "### Step 1: Dive Deeper into Hyperparameter Tuning Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "While we have already visualized the results of the hyperparameter tuning, we believe there's more to unearth. Consider how you might visualize the correlation between specific hyperparameters and model performance, or how different hyperparameter combinations affect the training time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Unearth Hidden Trends in Customer Sentiment\n",
    "\n",
    "ModaMetric prides itself on delivering the best for our customers. Can we use our sentiment analysis data to learn more about our customer preferences? Try to create visualizations that show trends in sentiment across different clothing categories, times of year, or any other dimension you find interesting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Explore Advanced Visualization Techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "Metaflow can accommodate a wide range of data visualization techniques. This is your chance to showcase those advanced skills. Perhaps you could experiment with multi-panel plots, 3D visualizations, or interactive plots that let viewers explore the data for themselves. You can refer to this [blog post](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjJwOe55pqAAxXA6KACHTZzAsoQFnoECCAQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fouterbounds.com%2Fblog%2Fintegrating-pythonic-visual-reports-into-ml-pipelines%2F&usg=AOvVaw2PY3huULq5xR3yZEQ1s-OL&opi=89978449) for more information about how you may do this. \n",
